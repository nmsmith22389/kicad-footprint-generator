# The Inductor2 generator simplifies generation of centered, rectangular
# footprints with exactly two pads.
# Dimensions are automatically added to the footprint description as WxHmm.
# 
# The footprint is automatically centered and placed horizontically 
# (with the pads at the left & right).
# The pads are equally aligned around the center to have the specified step.
# 
# This is the pad step:
#  +---+     +---+
#  |   |     |   |
#  |   |  x  |   |
#  |   |     |   |
#  +---+     +---+
#    |<------->|
