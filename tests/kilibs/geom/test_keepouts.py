"""Tests for the graphical keepout classes.

These are not intended to be exhaustive, but mostly for a demonstration of how to use
the classes, as well as a place to put some simple tests to catch fiddly edge cases if
needed.

Exhaustive tests are high maintenance, and regressions will normally be much more
obvious by the visual diffs of the generated graphics than by delicate stacks of
numerical tests.
